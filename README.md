Frontend mentor challenge with additional features, such as pagination, favorite countries, search bar, and select option.
For this application, I used React with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query for fetching data from the API. For styling, I used Tailwind CSS.

On the homepage, we have the ability to search countries by name and filter them by region.
We can use pagination and by clicking on a country, we can see more information and we can switch between dark and light mode.

Clicking on the "Add to favorites" button allows us to add a country to the favorites array that is stored in local storage and then rendered in the FavoritesCountries component. Within the component, we can remove a country by clicking on "Remove from favorites".
